## Getting Started

On Flutter, make an application - an expense tracker. The application must:

1. Allow to add data about the purchase made: what was bought, how much and on what day.
1. Show a list of purchases made in reverse chronological order (newest first).
1. Remove completed purchases from the list, with confirmation of the action.
1. Save purchase history locally so that no data is lost when the application is restarted.
1. Allow to watch spending on a monthly basis. That is, in April so much, in March so and so.
1. Edit already entered expenses
